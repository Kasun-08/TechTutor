                            Artificial Intelligence (AI) isn’t just about technology—it’s about making a real difference in people’s lives. Imagine using AI to tackle big problems like natural disasters, healthcare access, protecting the environment, and making sure everyone has a fair chance in education. When disasters strike, AI can help predict them early. By analysing lots of data quickly, AI can give warnings and help emergency teams respond faster. This saves lives and reduces damage.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            In healthcare, AI can improve how doctors diagnose and treat illnesses. It can analyze health data to catch diseases sooner and give better advice. AI also helps people in remote areas talk to doctors online, getting medical help they might not have had before.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            For the environment, AI keeps an eye on things like deforestation and climate changes. It uses data from satellites to track how our planet is changing. This helps us protect natural resources and plan smarter for the future.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            In schools, AI can personalize learning. It adapts lessons to fit each student’s needs, making sure everyone gets the help they need to learn. This means better education for all kids, no matter where they live.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            To help communities with AI, workshops and projects can get people involved. They can brainstorm ideas and create AI solutions that solve local problems. By working together, we can use AI to build a better world where everyone benefits.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            In summary, AI isn’t just a fancy technology—it’s a tool for making life better for everyone. By using AI wisely and thinking about how it can help people, we can make big changes in our neighbourhoods and across the globe.
